## Project Overview

This is a local Kubernetes cluster setup project, with plans to explore OpenShift for in-house local hosting.

## Project Status

- Empty repository - starting fresh
- Target: Local Kubernetes cluster (considering OpenShift)
- Purpose: In-house locally hosted cluster

## Development Environment

Since this is a fresh project focused on Kubernetes/OpenShift setup, common commands will likely include:

- Container orchestration setup and management
- Cluster configuration and deployment
- Service management and monitoring

## Architecture Notes

This project will focus on containerized infrastructure and cluster management rather than traditional application development.
